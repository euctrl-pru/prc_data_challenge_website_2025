## Criteria for Ranking Submissions

Ranking will be based on the best RMSE of a team's submissions.


There will be two phases of submissions:

1. phase 1: till 2025-11-09T23:59:59Z \
   Ranking will be based on `submission.csv`
1. phase 2: from 2025-11-10T00:00:00Z till 2025-11-30T23:59:59Z \
   ranking will be based on `submission-final.csv` 




### Eligibility for Prize

The winning submissions/solutions will only be eligible for the awards if

* all source code and additional data sets used will be made available to be
  published under the **GNU GPLv3 license** on the Challenge github account.
* sufficient documentation is provided to understand and reproduce the results.
* the solution is _original_: teams must use their own original solutions.
  Re-using any existing implementation is only allowed if the original authors 
  grant you the rights to use their solution and if you made significant
  modifications to the algorithm or model.
  In particular, simply re-using existing code and rewriting the data input and 
  output mechanism is not sufficient. Adding parameters to the model and 
  modifying filters to match the specific peculiarities of the data, however,
  can be considered sufficient. 


### Final Prize 

The Selection Committee will review and discuss the top ranking teams and
select final Awardees considering

1. their final ranking score,
1. the originality of the proposed model
1. the open availability of the code and the relevant documentation provided.

By participating in the Challenge, you agree to be bound by the final decision
of the PRC Data Challenge selection committee.
