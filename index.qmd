title: "PRC Data Challenge 2025"
---

The \acr{PRC} with the support of [OpenSky Network](https://opensky-network.org/)
aims at engaging with data scientists, even without
Aviation background, to team up and compete to solve a (big-ish) Data Challenge
of interest to the wider Aviation community using open data and openly sharing
final solutions.

The 2025 edition of the \acr{PRC} Data Challenge builds on top of the 2024
edition and proposes to build \acr{ML} models to predict the **amount of fuel
burnt** at certain intervals of the flight.
The training dataset will consist of flight intervals and corresponding fuel
burnt/flown amounts.

The competition runs (in two phases) from 1st Oct till 30th Nov 2025.  
The total amount for the first 3 teams is 5000 EUR.  
Check the conditions for [eligibility for prize](ranking.qmd#eligibility)
and then fill the following team creation request form!\

::: {.callout-warning title="NOTE"}
Make sure to have a **valid/verified OpenSky Network account**, i.e.
try to [log in](https://opensky-network.org/login).  
You will need to specify your *account* in the team creation form...

Your request will be assessed and eventually approved.   
You will receive an email with the relevant
access keys to the datasets/buckets and the automatically generated team name.

Remember to follow up the data challenge on OSN's Discord
{{< fa brands discord >}} channel [`#prc-data-competition`][prc-discord].  
(if not already done, you need to access [OSN Discord server](https://discord.gg/RPh89jpVVz) first)

This is a data challenge that uses real data with all the inconsistencies,
noise, holes of the real world: it is a *challenge* because it is tough 
in its goal and in the available data, and not a mere tutorial or synthetic
exercise.


## Thanks

The organization of this challenge would have not been possible without the
creativity and dedication of Junzi Sun, the proficiency of John Fitzgerald and
the help of the *Friends of OSN*, Allan, Quinten, Martin, Rainer, Xavier and
Kamil among them.

![](media/osky-logo-banner.png){height=30px} OpenSky Network is of course the valuable organization without which we wouldn't
be able to assemble this challenge at all.

## Disclaimer

Please note that this challenge is a challenge in its own preparation, so 
**everything is experimental and subject to change at any moment
at the organizers' discretion**.  
We anyway do our best to prepare for an interesting and quality experience.
