title: "PRC Data Challenge 2025"
---

The \acr{PRC} aims at engaging with data scientists, even without
Aviation background, to team up and compete to solve a (big-ish) Data Challenge
of interest to the wider Aviation community using open data and openly sharing
final solutions.

The 2025 edition of the \acr{PRC} Data Challenge builds on top of the 2024
edition and proposes to build \acr{ML} models to predict the **amount of fuel
burnt** at certain intervals of the flight.
The training dataset will consist of flight intervals and corresponding fuel
burnt/flown amounts.

An example of a flight from Amsterdam to San Francisco is shown below with 
the great  circle trajectory in [orange]{fg="white" bg="orange"} and the ACARS
segments in [blue]{fg="white" bg="blue"}.

This is a data challenge that uses real data with all the inconsistencies,
noise, holes of the real world: it is a *challenge* because it is tough 
in its goal and in the available data, and not a mere tutorial or syntetic
exercise.
