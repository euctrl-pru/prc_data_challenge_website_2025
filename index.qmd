title: "PRC Data Challenge 2025"
---

The \acr{PRC} aims at engaging with data scientists, even without
Aviation background, to team up and compete to solve a (big-ish) Data Challenge
of interest to the wider Aviation community using open data and openly sharing
final solutions.

The 2025 edition of the \acr{PRC} Data Challenge builds on top of the 2024
edition and proposes to build \acr{ML} models to predict the **amount of fuel
flown** at certain intervals of the flight.
