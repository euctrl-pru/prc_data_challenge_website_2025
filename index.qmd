title: "PRC Data Challenge 2025"
---

The \acr{PRC} aims at engaging with data scientists, even without
Aviation background, to team up and compete to solve a (big-ish) Data Challenge
of interest to the wider Aviation community using open data and openly sharing
final solutions.

![PRC Data Challenge](media/PRC-Data-challenge-1080x1080.jpg)

The 2025 edition of the \acr{PRC} Data Challenge builds on top of the 2024
edition and proposes to build \acr{ML} models to predict the **amount of fuel
burnt** at certain intervals of the flight.
The training dataset will consist of flight intervals and corresponding fuel
burnt/flown amounts.

The competition runs (in two phases) from 1st Oct till 30th Nov 2025.  
The total amount for the first 3 teams is 5000 EUR.  
Check the conditions for [eligibility for prize](ranking.qmd#eligibility)

This is a data challenge that uses real data with all the inconsistencies,
noise, holes of the real world: it is a *challenge* because it is tough 
in its goal and in the available data, and not a mere tutorial or synthetic
exercise.


## Thanks

The organization of this challenge would have not been possible without the
creativity and dedication of Junzi Sun, the proficiency of John Fitzgerald and
the help of the *Friend of OSN*, Allan, Quinten, Martin, Rainer, Xavier and
Kamil among them.
