We provide a submission file for fuel where to fill the fuel burnt column.

**Note**: each phase will have its own.


Each team will have to submit in its own bucket.

### Submission format

You should submit a CSV file with exactly all entries in the CSV submission file
with a numerical value for the fuel flown for a each interval, like

```
idx flight_id    start               end                 fuel_kg
  0 prc770822360 2025-04-13 04:31:04 2025-04-13 05:01:04   2500 
  1 prc770822360 2025-04-13 05:01:04 2025-04-13 05:16:04   1200.
  2 prc770822360 2025-04-13 05:16:04 2025-04-13 05:46:04   2500
