We provide a submission file for each phase of the Challenge,
`fuel_rank_submission.parquet` for phase 1 and
`fuel_final_submission.parquet` for phase 2.

For phase 1 there are companion trajectories and flight list.

Each team will have to submit its predictions in its own bucket, with a
file name template as follows

> `submission_v<incremental integer>.parquet`  
> `submission-final_v<incremental integers>.parquet`

The `fuel_rank_submission.parquet` (`fuel_final_submission.parquet`) payload
looks something like

```
idx     flight_id                start                  end  fuel_kg
  0  prc770822360  2025-04-13 04:31:04  2025-04-13 05:01:04      0.0

### Submission format

You should submit a **parquet** file with your predictions with exactly all
entries as in in `fuel_rank_submission.parquet`
(`fuel_final_submission.parquet`), i.e. something with a payload like:

```
idx     flight_id                start                  end  fuel_kg
  0  prc770822360  2025-04-13 04:31:04  2025-04-13 05:01:04    250.3 
  1  prc770822360  2025-04-13 05:01:04  2025-04-13 05:16:04    120.8
  2  prc770822360  2025-04-13 05:16:04  2025-04-13 05:46:04   2500 
  3  prc770822360  2025-04-13 05:46:04  2025-04-13 06:01:04   1300.9 
...
```

In fact only `idx` and `fuel_kg` will be considered by the ranking script when
calculating the RMSE.

Missing rows will be given a value of `0` (zero)[^down] for the corresponding
`fuel_kg`.
