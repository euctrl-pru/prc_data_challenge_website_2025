We provide a submission file for each phase of the Challenge,
`submission.csv` for phase 1 and `submission-final.csv` for phase 2.
These have companion trajectories and flight list.

Each team will have to submit its predictions in its own bucket, with a
file name template as follows (for each phase respectively)

> `submission_v<incremental integer>.csv`
> `submission-final_v<incremental integers>.csv`

The `submission.csv` (`submission-final.csv`) file looks something like

```
idx,   flight_id,                start,                 end,  fuel_kg
  0, prc770822360, 2025-04-13 04:31:04, 2025-04-13 05:01:04,

### Submission format

You should submit a CSV file with exactly all entries in the CSV submission file
with a numerical value for the fuel flown/burnt `fuel_kg` for a each interval,
like:

```
idx,    flight_id,               start,                end,  fuel_kg
  0, prc770822360, 2025-04-13 04:31:04, 2025-04-13 05:01:04,    250.3 
  1, prc770822360, 2025-04-13 05:01:04, 2025-04-13 05:16:04,    120.8
  2, prc770822360, 2025-04-13 05:16:04, 2025-04-13 05:46:04,   2500 
  3, prc770822360, 2025-04-13 05:46:04, 2025-04-13 06:01:04,   1300.9 
...
```

In fact only `idx` and `fuel_kg` will be considered by the ranking script when
calculating the RMSE.

Missing rows will be given a value of `0` (zero).
