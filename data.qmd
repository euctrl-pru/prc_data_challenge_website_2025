We provide the following (logical) data sets:

1. **flights list** information
1. (portions of) **trajectories** for the flights in the list
1. **fuel burnt/flown** for one or more intervals in each flight
1. **airport coordinates**

In an ER diagram

The temporal extent of the datasets covers the period Apr - Oct 2025.

* Apr - Aug: training dataset
* Sep 2025: phase 1 submission / ranking
* Oct 2025: phase 2 submission / final ranking



## Fuel Burnt/Flown

We collected fuel information (via Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)) for
flights between April and September 2025.

The columns of the fuel flown/burnt dataset are (`d_` stands for delta): 

* `idx`: row id
* `flight_id`: a unique identifier of the flight in the flight list
* `start`: a time instant (\acr{UTC})
* `end`: a time instant (\acr{UTC})
* `fob_start`: value of fuel on board at `start`
* `fob_end`: value of fuel on board at `end`
* `d_fob`: `fob_end` - `fob_start`
* `likely_fob_unit`: likely unit of fob values
* `fuel_kg`: fuel burnt between start and end


## Flight list

The following is the list of columns in the flight list dataset:

* `flight_id`: a unique identifier for the flight
* `flight_date`: the date of the flight
* `takeoff`: the \acr{UTC} timestamp of the take-off time
* `origin_name`: the name of \acr{ADEP}
* `origin_icao`: the \acr{ICAO} code of the \acr{ADEP}, the origin of the flight
* `landed`: the \acr{UTC} timestamp of the landing time
* `destination_icao`: the \acr{ICAO} code of the \acr{ADES}, the destination
   of the flight
* `destination_name`: the name of \acr{ADEP}
* `aircraft_type`: the \acr{ICAO} aircraft type code of the aircraft carrying
  out the flight



## Trajectories

We have trajectory files for each flight with fuel flow segments.
These are (mainly) \acr{ADS-B} position reports for the flights in
the flight list as available in OpenSky Network historical database.
These flight trajectories are possibly incomplete, i.e. they can lack portions.
We have augmented these trajectories with positional information
coming from ACARS; the `source` column would categorize the origin
of the data, either `adsb` or `acars`.

Each trajectory is described by (units in square brackets)

* `flight_id`: an identifier for the flight (details in the flight
               list dataset), i.e. `prc770822360`
* `timestamp`: timestamp for the position report [UTC]
* `longitude`: longitude in \acr{DD} in [-180, 180] range
* `latitude`: latitude in \acr{DD} in [-90, 90] range
* `altitude`: altitude [ft]
* `groundspeed`: ground speed [knots, kt]
* `track`: track angle in \acr{DD}
* `vertical_rate`: vertical rate of climb/descent [ft/min]
* `mach`: the Mach number (from `source` = `acars`)
* `typecode`: the ICAO aircraft type, i.e. `A21N` for the Airbus A321neo
* `TAS`: **T**rue **A**ir**S**peed (from `source` = `acars`) [kt]
* `CAS`: **C**alibrated **A**ir**S**peed (from `source` = `acars`) [kt]
* `source`: the origin of the information; it can be `adsb` or `acars`

## Airports

The airports dataset provides complementary positions as follows:

* `icao`: the \acr{ICAO} code of the airport
* `longitude`: the airport longitude in \acr{DD} in [-180, 180] range
* `latitude`: the airport latitude in \acr{DD} in [-90, 90] range
* `elevation`: the airport elevation [ft]
