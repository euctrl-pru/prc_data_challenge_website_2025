For the training set, we provide the outcome, the “ground truth”, for all the known intervals of fuel flown amount. Your model will be based on “features” like aircraft type and phase of the flight. You will also use feature engineering to create new features.\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for the relevant intervals of the flight. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each interval in a flight in the test set, use the model you trained to predict the amount of fuel flown.",

It provides objective information and independent advice to EUROCONTROL’s governing bodies on European ATM performance, based on extensive research, data analysis and consultation with stakeholders. Its purpose is “to ensure the effective management of the European air traffic management System through a strong, transparent and independent performance review” (Article 1 of Performance Review Commission 2003).\nYou can find further details in the AIU Portal PRC page.\n\nReferences\n\n\nPerformance Review Commission. 2003. “PRC Terms of\nReference and Rules of\nProcedure.” EUROCONTROL. https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/2021-04/prc-terms-reference-rules-procedure.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Acronyms\n\nPRC: Performance Review Commission",
