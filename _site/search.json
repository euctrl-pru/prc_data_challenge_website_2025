The training dataset will consist of flight intervals and corresponding fuel burnt/flown amounts.\nAn example of a flight from Amsterdam to San Francisco is shown below with the great circle trajectory in orange and the ACARS segments in blue.\n\n\n\nGreat circle (orange) and ACARS segment (blue) with fuel burnt info.\n\n\nThis is a data challenge that uses real data with all the inconsistencies, noise, holes of the real world: it is a challenge because it is tough in its goal and in the available data, and not a mere tutorial or syntetic exercise.\n\n\n\nList of Acronyms\n\nML: Machine Learning\nPRC: Performance Review Commission",

Re-using any existing implementation is only allowed if the original authors grant you the rights to use their solution and if you made significant modifications to the algorithm or model. In particular, simply re-using existing code and rewriting the data input and output mechanism is not sufficient. Adding parameters to the model and modifying filters to match the specific peculiarities of the data, however, can be considered sufficient.\n\n\n\nFinal Prize\nThe Selection Committee will review and discuss the top ranking teams and select final Awardees considering\n\ntheir final ranking score,\nthe originality of the proposed model\nthe open availability of the code and the relevant documentation provided.\n\nBy participating in the Challenge, you agree to be bound by the final decision of the PRC Data Challenge selection committee.",
