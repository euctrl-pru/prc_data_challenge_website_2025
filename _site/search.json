For the training set, we provide the outcome, the “ground truth”, for all the known intervals of fuel flown amounts. Your model will be based on “features” like aircraft type and phase of the flight. You will also use feature engineering to create new features.\nThe test set should be used to see how well your model performs on unseen data. For the test set, we do not provide the ground truth for the relevant intervals of the flight. It is your job to predict these outcomes. For each interval in a flight in the test set, use the model you trained to predict the amount of fuel flown.\nprovide format and description for all 3\n\n\nSubmission format\nYou should submit a CSV file with exactly all entries in the submission.csv with a numerical value for fuel flown for a each interval\nflight_id,start,end,fuel-flown\n12345,\"2025-04-23 04:32:23\",\"2025-04-23 04:51:00\",135.6\n12345,\"2025-04-23 06:11:13\",\"2025-04-23 07:01:10\",153.2\n23456,\"2025-05-01 13:21:54\",\"2025-05-01 14:07:55\",198.1\n...",
