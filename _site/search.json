    "text": "Thanks\nThe Performance Review Commission (PRC) aims at engaging with data scientists, even without Aviation background, to team up and compete to solve a (big-ish) Data Challenge of interest to the wider Aviation community using open data and openly sharing final solutions.\nThe 2025 edition of the PRC Data Challenge builds on top of the 2024 edition and proposes to build Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the amount of fuel burnt at certain intervals of the flight. The training dataset will consist of flight intervals and corresponding fuel burnt/flown amounts.\nThe competition runs (in two phases) from 1st Oct till 30th Nov 2025.\nThe total amount for the first 3 teams is 5000 EUR.\nCheck the conditions for eligibility for prize and then fill the following team creation request form!\nYour request will be processed and you will then receive the relevant info to access the datasets and be able to submit your predictions.\nRemember to follow up the data challenge on OSN’s Discord  channel #prc-data-competition.\nBelow you can find a couple of plots of flights showing the ACARS trajectory in red and the ADS-B one in blue.\nThis is a data challenge that uses real data with all the inconsistencies, noise, holes of the real world: it is a challenge because it is tough in its goal and in the available data, and not a mere tutorial or synthetic exercise.\nThe organization of this challenge would have not been possible without the creativity and dedication of Junzi Sun, the proficiency of John Fitzgerald and the help of the Friend of OSN, Allan, Quinten, Martin, Rainer, Xavier and Kamil among them.",

Re-using any existing implementation is only allowed if the original authors grant you the rights to use their solution and if you made significant modifications to the algorithm or model. In particular, simply re-using existing code and rewriting the data input and output mechanism is not sufficient. Adding parameters to the model and modifying filters to match the specific peculiarities of the data, however, can be considered sufficient.\n\n\n\nFinal Prize\nWe reserved a total of 5000 EUR for the first 3 ranking teams.\nThe Selection Committee will review and discuss the top ranking teams and select final Awardees considering\n\ntheir final ranking score,\nthe originality of the proposed model\nthe open availability of the code and the relevant documentation provided.\n\nBy participating in the Challenge, you agree to be bound by the final decision of the PRC Data Challenge selection committee.",
