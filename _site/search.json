    "text": "Thanks\nThe Performance Review Commission (PRC) aims at engaging with data scientists, even without Aviation background, to team up and compete to solve a (big-ish) Data Challenge of interest to the wider Aviation community using open data and openly sharing final solutions.\nThe 2025 edition of the PRC Data Challenge builds on top of the 2024 edition and proposes to build Machine Learning (ML) models to predict the amount of fuel burnt at certain intervals of the flight. The training dataset will consist of flight intervals and corresponding fuel burnt/flown amounts.\nThe competition runs (in two phases) from 1st Oct till 30th Nov 2025.\nThe total amount for the first 3 teams is 5000 EUR.\nCheck the conditions for eligibility for prize and then fill the following team creation request form!\nRemember to follow up the data challenge on OSN’s Discord  channel #prc-data-competition.\n(if not already done, you need to access OSN Discord server first)\nBelow you can find a couple of plots of flights showing the ACARS trajectory in red and the ADS-B one in blue.\nThis is a data challenge that uses real data with all the inconsistencies, noise, holes of the real world: it is a challenge because it is tough in its goal and in the available data, and not a mere tutorial or synthetic exercise.\nThe organization of this challenge would have not been possible without the creativity and dedication of Junzi Sun, the proficiency of John Fitzgerald and the help of the Friends of OSN, Allan, Quinten, Martin, Rainer, Xavier and Kamil among them.",

Last year, I attended and passed a bootcamp training program in Data Engineering, field of skills I expect to implement in R&D activities to improve technical solutions design, but also in personal projects to analyze, understand and improve global behaviors in various subjects, such as the project you propose. Passionate about aeronautics, I passed my PPL license several years ago, among other licenses (ultralight, gliding, paragliding, …). Even if I do not fly currently (familial reasons), I think my pilot experiences will help me address this project.\nI am not experienced as a data scientist (Machine Learning), so I do not guarantee any performant solution : I take this participation as an opportunity to improve my knowledge in both data science and aeronautic operations.

It provides objective information and independent advice to EUROCONTROL’s governing bodies on European Air Traffic Management (ATM) performance, based on extensive research, data analysis and consultation with stakeholders. Its purpose is “to ensure the effective management of the European air traffic management System through a strong, transparent and independent performance review” (Article 1 of Performance Review Commission 2003).\nYou can find further details in the AIU Portal PRC page.\n\nReferences\n\n\nPerformance Review Commission. 2003. “PRC Terms of\nReference and Rules of\nProcedure.” EUROCONTROL. https://www.eurocontrol.int/sites/default/files/2021-04/prc-terms-reference-rules-procedure.pdf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of Acronyms\n\nATM: Air Traffic Management\nPRC: Performance Review Commission",
