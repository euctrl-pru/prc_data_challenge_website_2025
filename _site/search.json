Re-using any existing implementation is only allowed if the original authors grant you the rights to use their solution and if you made significant modifications to the algorithm or model. In particular, simply re-using existing code and rewriting the data input and output mechanism is not sufficient. Adding parameters to the model and modifying filters to match the specific peculiarities of the data, however, can be considered sufficient.\n\n\n\nFinal Prize\nWe reserved a total of 5000 EUR for the first 3 ranking teams.\nThe Selection Committee will review and discuss the top ranking teams and select final Awardees considering\n\ntheir final ranking score,\nthe originality of the proposed model\nthe open availability of the code and the relevant documentation provided.\n\nBy participating in the Challenge, you agree to be bound by the final decision of the PRC Data Challenge selection committee.",
