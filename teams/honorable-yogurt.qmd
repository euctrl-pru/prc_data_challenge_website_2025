### Description and Rationale
I am an air traffic management specialist and data scientist at ASECNA, an air navigation service provider in Africa. I decided to participate in the PRC Challenge to put into practice my expertise in handling and analyzing air traffic data, with a particular focus on surveillance technologies (ADS-B/Mode-S), safety and quality performance, and data-driven decision support.

My motivation is threefold:

Professional contribution – bringing the operational perspective of an ANSP to an international, data-driven challenge.

Environmental engagement – supporting efforts to estimate fuel burn and CO₂ emissions, and contributing to solutions that can help reduce aviation’s environmental footprint.

Personal development – strengthening my skills in data science and aviation performance analysis, while gaining visibility and contributing to collaborative innovation.

Through this challenge, I hope to bridge operational knowledge with data innovation, and support the development of smarter, safer, and greener air navigation services.
