## Description and Rationale

I am an Aerospace Engineering graduate with over 3 years of experience working as a machine learning engineer. I believe this competition is uniquely suited for me and will allow me to make the best use of my acquired skills to make a huge impact in how aircraft fuel consumption is predicted.
I know that accurately predicting fuel consumption will not only help optimize flight planning and increasing business profits but also go a long way in keeping the carbon footprint of the aviation industry in check and ultimately protecting the environment and making aviation sustainable.
