## Description and Rationale

Our goal is to explore the intersection of AI and air navigation performance by developing interpretable, high-performing models that extract operational insights from the ANS dataset.
We are particularly interested in:

Applying advanced timeâ€“space graph learning and feature engineering,

Evaluating system efficiency and delay factors,

And contributing open, reproducible methodologies to the ANS research community.
