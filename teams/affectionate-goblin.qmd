## Description and Rationale

I’m an AI engineer with two years of experience working on machine learning and data-driven projects. I enjoy joining data science competitions to keep learning, challenge myself, and try out new ideas. I joined the PRC Data Challenge 2025 because it’s a great chance to use AI on a real aviation problem and see how technology can help improve fuel efficiency and sustainability. Even though I don’t have an aviation background, I’m excited to dive into the data, learn along the way, and share useful insights. I see this challenge as a fun and meaningful way to blend innovation, learning, and collaboration.
