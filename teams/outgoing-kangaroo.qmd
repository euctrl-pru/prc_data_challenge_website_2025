### Description and Rationale
I am a Systems Engineering PhD student working in Center for Air Transportation Systems Research Lab where I study about flight operations and emissions using open-source data for US airspace. This would be a lovely opportunity to take on a challenge which is very much related to my domain and I am interested to see the end results.
