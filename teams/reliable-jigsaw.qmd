## Description and Rationale

I am a solo data science professional with a strong background in predictive modeling. I registered for the PRC Data Challenge because it offers a fascinating, real-world application of Machine Learning: predicting fuel burn from complex flight data. I am motivated to tackle this tough, operational challenge and deliver an accurate, high-quality solution that improves flight efficiency.
