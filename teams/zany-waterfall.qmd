### Description and Rationale
I’m a data scientist who loves Kaggle and data competitions. I enjoy solving real-world problems with data and learning from the community. I also have a passion for aviation, it started when I joined a Kaggle competition about contrail detection. I’m excited to keep learning, improving my models, and taking on new challenges!
