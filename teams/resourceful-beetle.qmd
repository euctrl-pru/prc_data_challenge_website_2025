## Description and Rationale

Our team brings together an academic perspective from Fırat University and operational field experience from DHMI, consisting of an Associate Professor and an active Air Traffic Controller who is also a recent M.Sc. graduate. Our primary motivation for joining this challenge is to learn and grow. We believe that working on real-world data provided by Eurocontrol will offer us invaluable experience in understanding complex ATM problems. We see this process as a key learning opportunity and an important step in our journey toward developing practical solutions for operational challenges.
