## Description and Rationale

French ML Engineer currently working in Belgium, 25 years old. I heard about this challenge from colleagues participating. Honestly, I don't know much about planes and all, but I thought it'd be fun to try an "alternative method" to tackle this problem 😊

## Details

* Type: Independent
* Country: Belgium

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(gt)

gt(tibble::tribble(
  ~id, ~forename,  ~surname,  ~affiliation,
   1L,  "Rayane", "Hachemi", "Independent"
  )
) |> cols_label(id = md("**ID**"), forename = md("**Forename**"), surname ~ md("**Surname**"), affiliation ~ md("**Affiliation**"))
```
