## Description and Rationale

I have masters in energy engineering with focus on sustainability. I am a novice when it comes to Machine learning but I do have little experience in Optimization, Deterministic fuel consumption for vehicles.

I came across OpenSky for my paper where we investigated how shifting policies shift air traffic. This challenge could enhance my knowledge.
