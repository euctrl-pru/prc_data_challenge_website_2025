## Description and Rationale

It is strongly related to the data. I have never really worked with this type of data and it is an opportunity to learn how to tackle such challenge

## Details

* Type: Industry
* Country: Madagascar

```{r echo=FALSE}
library(gt)

gt(tibble::tribble(
  ~id, ~forename, ~surname,  ~affiliation,
   1L,   "Xyzzy",  "XYZZY", "Undisclosed"
  )
) |> cols_label(id = md("**ID**"), forename = md("**Forename**"), surname ~ md("**Surname**"), affiliation ~ md("**Affiliation**"))
```
