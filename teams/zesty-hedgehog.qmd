## Description and Rationale

I am a student researcher at DLR Braunschweig with a Machine Learning (ML) background. I currently work on our Digital Controller for Air Traffic Control.

The PRC Data Challenge 2025 is a great opportunity for me to try out ML methods on new aviation datasets. Especially the comparison with other teams performances makes it very interesting.
