### Description and Rationale
I’m Wojciech, a data scientist from Poland and a huge aviation geek. If something can stay in the air, I’m interested in it. During my university days, I realized I could mix my work with my hobby — that’s how my diploma thesis came to life: “Analysis of Air Traffic in Germany During the COVID-19 Pandemic Based on the Seasonal ARIMA Model.”

Since then, I like to tinker with publicly available datasets and flight ticket search engines. Joining this aviation ML contest feels like the perfect way to combine my passion for data and aviation.
