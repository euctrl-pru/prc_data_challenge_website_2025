## Description and Rationale

We are a team of graduate students from The George Washington University, pursuing our M.S. in Computer Science, with strong interests in AI, data systems, and network security.

Our motivation for joining the PRC Challenge is to apply our technical and analytical skills to real-world aviation data, explore innovative solutions using machine learning and data-driven modeling, and contribute to advancing research in air traffic surveillance and cybersecurity.

We are excited to collaborate, learn from the global research community, and push our limits through this competition.
